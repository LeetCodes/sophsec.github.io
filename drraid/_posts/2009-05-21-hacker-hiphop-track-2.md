title: Hacker HipHop Track 2
---

I finally finished another track - [Nice Report](/downloads/nice_report.mp3).
It's name and content basically come from the false sense of security given
by a pentest/audit/advisory report. It also has abrasive lyrical assaults on
the media's relationship with the infosec industry, as well as general
disdain for script kiddies. My producer
[Conkrete](http://www.myspace.com/conkreteproduction) did all the recording
and mastering magic, and the beat was purchased from illbeatz.com.
Hope you enjoy it. Lyrics are [available here](/downloads/nice_report.txt).
