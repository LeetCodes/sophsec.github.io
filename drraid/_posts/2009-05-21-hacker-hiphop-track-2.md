title: Hacker HipHop Track 2
---

I finally finished another track - [Nice Report][1]. It's name and content
basically come from the false sense of security given by a
pentest/audit/advisory report. It also has abrasive lyrical assaults on
the media's relationship with the infosec industry, as well as general
disdain for script kiddies. My producer [Conkrete][2] did all the recording
and mastering magic, and the beat was purchased from illbeatz.com.
Hope you enjoy it. Lyrics are [available here][3].
