Postmodern and Pierce are pimping up teh intertr0ns!

Pierce recently presented on his tool
[Seeds-of-Contempt](http://code.google.com/p/seedsofcontempt/) at
[Viz-SEC](http://www.vizsec.org/), with awesome response from the masses.
Seeds-of-Contempt provides a visual means of monitoring and attacking
network traffic, as well as remote "resource management" functionality ;]. 

Postmodern Modulus III has publicly released the first version of
[Ronin](http://ronin-ruby.github.com/), and now with
[docs](http://ronin-ruby.github.com/resources/everyday_ronin.html).
Having personally seen him present on the same documentation and demonstrate
Ronin's capacity, I have to say the power Ronin puts at your fingertips for
on-the-fly hacking is phenomenal.

ps. with these guys makin me look so bad, i'll have to finally finish
someting cool to post here.
