title: Hacker Hip Hop
---

While we're finishing up some research content here at SophSec, I've
decided to kick it up a notch by publishing a Hacker HipHop track.
Big props to my good friend and producer [Conkrete][1]- he's seriously a
top-grade musical composer and engineer, and I was lucky enough to have his
beat and engineering for this track. The song is called [clockwork][2] and the
lyrics for the track are [available][3].

The music is distinguished hacker rap, not to be confused with nerdcore, and
makes harsh statements addressed towards whitefat industry and skript kiddie
culture. It has been nominated for best song at this years BlackHat Pwnie
Awards (WOOT) and if I'm lucky, wins ;].
