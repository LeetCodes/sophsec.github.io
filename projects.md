[Seeds of Contempt](http://code.google.com/p/seedsofcontempt/) - 
Contempt is a framework for designing visual representations of data
obtained in a penetration test. Contempt is implemented using the Eclipse
Rich Client Platform. Plugins to the framework provide tabs on the
interface. Tabs can provide things such as visualizations, database
interaction, or network scanners.

A seed is an extensible framework for resource management (cpu, gpu,
database, network device, etc). It runs as a daemon on a system, and
accepts commands from the contempt UI. Seeds can then act as "agents",
able to direct network flow, and distribute such things as cpu and
database resources over large networks.
