## Projects we Like

### Dev

[CMake](http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Index.html) - A cross-platform,
open-source build-system system. Autoconf and libtool are shit, please
stop using them.

[MessagePack](http://msgpack.org) - MessagePack is a binary-based efficient
object serialization library. It enables to exchange structured objects between 
many languages like JSON. But unlike JSON, it is very _fast_ and _small_.

[Redis](http://redis.io) - Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store.
It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain
strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets. Redis rocks, go use it, right now.

[DataMapper](http://datamapper.org/) - DataMapper is a 
[ORM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)
written in Ruby. Lets you focus on working with the Data, without having
to write SQL all day.

### Reversing / Debugging

[YASM](http://yasm.tortall.net/) - A complete rewrite of the NASM assembler.
Yasm currently supports the x86 and AMD64 instruction sets, accepts NASM and
GAS assembler syntaxes, outputs binary, ELF32, ELF64, 32 and 64-bit Mach-O,
RDOFF2, COFF, Win32, and Win64 object formats, and generates source debugging
information in STABS, DWARF 2, and CodeView 8 formats.

[udis86](http://udis86.sourceforge.net) - udis86 is an easy-to-use minimalistic 
disassembler library (libudis86) for the x86 and x86-64 class of instruction
set architectures. The primary intent of the design and development of udis86
is to aid software development projects that entail binary code analysis.
udis86 rocks so much that postmodern wrote Ruby FFI
[bindings](http://github.com/sophsec/ffi-udis86#readme) for it.

[vtrace](http://www.kenshoto.com/vtrace/) - Vtrace is a very useful python
debugging framework, with neat functionality like remote debugging.
It is written by some leeto dorito type haxors.

### Misc

[TRE](http://laurikari.net/tre/) - A lightweight, robust, and efficient POSIX
compliant regexp matching library with some exciting features such as
approximate (fuzzy) matching.

[zzuf](http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/zzuf) - A transparent application input 
fuzzer. Its purpose is to find bugs in applications by corrupting their
user-contributed data (which more than often comes from untrusted sources on
the Internet). It works by intercepting file and network operations and
changing random bits in the programâ€™s input.

[OminOS](http://ominos.sourceforge.net/) - A brand new OS written from the
ground up by SophSec affiliate and friend Omin0us. Woot. PS. We will pay
$20 and a round of drinks to the author of the first OminOS remote 0day
(just kidding..).
