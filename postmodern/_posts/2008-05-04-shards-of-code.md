title: Shards of Code
---

Been a while since we last updated [sophsec.com](/). You see we've been busy 
chasing the great hackerican dream. You know the one, quad-core computers,
a beautiful window manager theme and contributing to your neighborhoods
artistic aeshetic via graffiti.

Well we're back like a rash with some new content which we will be adding to over the next few months. I give you the first on our list,
[Shards of Code](http://github.com/sophsec/shards/). Shards is SophSec's
version of [DZone snippets](http://snippets.dzone.com/), except shards
sounds edgier. We will try to document the code we post, illustrating
common usage, limitations and any dependencies. 

Check it [out](http://github.com/sophsec/shards/).
