title: RSS Feeds and Permalinks
---

Oh, what is that orange-square thing up in your address-bar,
I belive it is a per-blog RSS Feeds. That's right, now you can keep
up-to-date on all the SophSec goings-ons, via your RSS enabled iPhone,
Refrigerator or Smart-Shoe (tm).

We also added linkable permalinks to sections, sub-sections, downloads and
news items (required for direct RSS links).

Building this site has been tons of fun.
