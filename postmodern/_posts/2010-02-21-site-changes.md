title: Site Changes
---

It's been a while since we have updated the website. So, SophSec decided
that it's time once again for the annual website redesign. Our first goal
was to better organize the content on the site, and then work on changing
it's apperance. And man this gray theme is getting me down, definitely
not sketchy enough.

The first major change to the site is user blogs for SophSec members. Not
only can you read the main SophSec blog, but can focus on what individual
members are ranting about:

* [SophSec](/)
* [cd](/cd/)
* [drraid](/drraid/)
* [pierce](/pierce/)
* [postmodern](/postmodern/)

Additionally we've added Atom RSS Feeds to the blogs. If you were subscribed
to the old RSS feed, you will need to re-subscribe:

* [SophSec's feed](/atom.xml)
* [cd's feed](/cd/atom.xml)
* [drraid's feed](/drraid/atom.xml)
* [pierce's feed](/pierce/atom.xml)
* [postmodern's feed](/postmodern/atom.xml)
