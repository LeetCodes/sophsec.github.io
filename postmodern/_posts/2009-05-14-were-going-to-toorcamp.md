title: We're Going to ToorCamp
---

That's right you read correctly, we are going to
[ToorCamp](http://toorcamp.org/), and I will be giving a
[talk](http://toorcamp.org/content/B5) there on
[Ronin](http://ronin-ruby.github.com/).

Now some of you maybe wondering, how could a group who rarely updates their
Blog, be giving a talk at a Hacker Camp in a Missile Silo? Well one's
productivity is not proportional to how much you Blog. In fact, those of
you with Twitter accounts are creating negative productivity.

The other contributing factors for us going to ToorCamp are:

* Ronin has been developed on for around three years now.
* We already had slides prepared.
* It's in a fucking Missile Silo.

To the others who will be attending ToorCamp, we at SophSec highly
recommend you also catch Chris Abad's
[talk](http://toorcamp.org/content/B8) on Analog Electronics and
Functional Programming.
