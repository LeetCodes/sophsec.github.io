# Joomlascan Not as Ghey

* Author: [cd](/cd/)
* Language: Python

## Description

A Multithreaded Joomla RFI Scanner. Taken from darkc0de.com and made into a semi-usable tool.
It's not the 90s anymore. If you are writing a scanner/brute-forcer and it's not forking/threading,
you're doing it wrong.
