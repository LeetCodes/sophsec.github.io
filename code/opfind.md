# Opfind

* Author: [drraid](/drraid/)
* Language: C

## Description

Opfind.c is a simple program to find jmp and call locations in a given
binary. It was inspired by Ryan Permeh's findjmp, and extended to add some
functionality such as `jmp [reg+i]`. It may be useful for finding jump
offsets in a binary/dll for ret-to-location style exploitation.
