# stackfhex

* Author: [drraid](/drraid/)
* Language: C

## Description

stackfhex is a simple program to automate the task of converting strings/data into 4-byte push statements.
This simplifies what is normally a tedious task in x86 shellcode development, reversing the string for
little-endian'ness, and then padding the data as necessary, outputting in ready-to-go assembly
push expressions.
