# ShellDecode

* Author: [drraid](/drraid/)
* Language: C

## Description

A really basic x86 disassembler for viewing shellcode. Perfect for when you want to examine
the shellcode from an exploit. Reads in the a binary file containing shellcode, outputs the
asm for the ops. Uses libdisasm for heavy lifting. Seriously trivial, infinitely useful.
